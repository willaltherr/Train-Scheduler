# Train-Scheduler
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

1. What the project does:
In this project you create a template in whihc you are able to add a train from a form that gets added to a table that shows the current train schedule.  Since the trains continuosly come, it will also show their next arrivals and the minutes away.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful becuase it teaches us to use firebase real-time data storage and moment.js which helps us utilize time in our websites.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with this project by adding a train and then watching the time update as the trains come and go.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If users need help with the project then they can go to my repo and review the code.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
